Hubs:
    1) They broadcast incoming data to each node. 
    2) There is no filtering.
    3) Increase in traffic, decrease in bandwidth.
    4) Collisions cause data loss.
    5) When devices connected to hub, they create one collsion domainn one broadcast domain.
    6) works on layer 1.

Switches:
    1) They dont broadcast data.
    2) They are intelligent and keep the record of source mac addresses.
    3) The incoming data is only sent to mentioned mac address. 
    4) Decrease in traffic, increase in bandwidth.
    5) When devices connected to switch, they create n collision domains, one broadcast domain.
    6) works on layer 2.
